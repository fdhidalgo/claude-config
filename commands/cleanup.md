Go through the current project directory and identify temporary scripts, data files, and documentation files that should be moved to a `./backup` directory. 

For each file you identify:
1. If you're certain it's temporary/backup material (like .tmp files, backup copies, outdated scripts), move it directly
2. If you're uncertain whether it should be moved, ask for approval before moving it

Create the `backup` directory if it doesn't exist. Organize files in the backup directory with appropriate subdirectories if needed (e.g., `backup/scripts/`, `backup/data/`, `backup/docs/`).

Provide a summary of what was moved and what requires approval.
